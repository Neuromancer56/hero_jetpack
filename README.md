#This mod recreates the flight mechanic of the game H.E.R.O.
hero_jetpack is a fork of sum_jetpack mod by Sumi (info@sumianvoice.com)
The point of this mod is to be a part of a set of mods that recreate the game H.E.R.O. in Minetest.  (one of my favorite childhood games)  
To that end, one of the major changes is that this forked version of mod requires you to tap or press the space bar to maintain altitude making flying more interesting and challenging.
H.E.R.O. gameplay can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD0VTuVQ6Tg

There will be a number of mods all beginning with "hero_" so that eventually if you enable all of them you will essentially be playing the game hero.
The plan is to have all of these "hero" mods function as stand alone mods so that they can combined in other ways with other mods to work with and create other games.
